✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run:

```bash
nx serve homepage
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```bash
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects:

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build homepage` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Hosting

### Overview

This project is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for your Next.js application.
   - Build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/homepage:latest .
     ```

2. **Push the Docker Image to Azure Container Registry**:
   - Log in to Azure Container Registry:
     ```bash
     az acr login --name <your-acr-name>
     ```
   - Push the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/homepage:latest
     ```

3. **Create Kubernetes Manifests**:
   - Create deployment and service manifests in the `k8s` directory.

4. **Apply the Manifests to AKS**:
   - Get AKS credentials:
     ```bash
     az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-aks-cluster>
     ```
   - Note: You need `kubelogin` to connect to an AAD-enabled AKS cluster. Install it using:
     ```bash
     brew install Azure/kubelogin/kubelogin
     ```
   - Apply the manifests:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
     kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
     ```

5. **Check the Deployment**:
   - Check the status of the deployment:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Get the external IP of the service:
     ```bash
     kubectl get svc homepage
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://<external-ip>:3000`

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**: The JSON output from `az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "{myApp}" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id} --sdk-auth`.
2. **ACR_NAME**: The name of your Azure Container Registry.
3. **AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP**: The resource group of your AKS cluster.
4. **AKS_CLUSTER_NAME**: The name of your AKS cluster.
